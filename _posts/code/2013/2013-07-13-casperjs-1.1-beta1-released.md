I'm happy to annouce the immediate availability of [CasperJS 1.1-beta1](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/releases/tag/1.1-beta1), featuring support for [SlimerJS](http://slimerjs.org/), which basically ports the [PhantomJS API](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/API-Reference) onto the [Gecko platform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko).

Yes, that means as of 1.1-beta1 you can run most of your existing CasperJS scripts against a headless Firefox (using a virtual framebuffer for now), thanks to the huge amount of effort provided by [Laurent Jouanneau](http://ljouanneau.com/), a long-time XUL/Gecko contributor.

This is great news for all Web developers wanting to avoid contributing to the [establishment of a monoculture](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-reasons-to-reject-webkit-monoculture/).

1.1-beta1 brings a whole lot more other features, you may want to read the [full CHANGELOG](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/releases/tag/1.1-beta1).
