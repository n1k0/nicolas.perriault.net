[Gandi](http://gandi.net/) offers a [free SSL certificate](http://wiki.gandi.net/en/ssl/free) during one year for any domain you buy there, nice. But the setup is a bit tedious and the documentation a bit disparate, so here's an attempt for a comprehensive howto for configuring a secured [nginx](http://nginx.org/) vhost using your *free* certificate.

**Disclaimer:** *Gandi's quite complicated email confirmation and validation workflow won't be covered in this post. Just ensure you can receive emails at `admin@domain.tld` where `domain.tld` is your domain.*

## Creating your certificate

On your server, ensure you have the [`openssl`](http://openssl.org/) command available or install it. Then, [generate your CSR](http://wiki.gandi.net/en/ssl/csr) (`domain.tld` is your actual domain):

```terminal
$ openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout domain.tld.key \
    -out domain.tld.csr
```

Answer a few questions from the program, but here's the most important bit: **enter your domain or subdomain when prompted to provide a _Common Name_**:

    Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: domain.tld

As they say:

> The process will create 2 files: a public `.csr` file, and a private `.key` file which you must absolutely keep private.

**Note:** *Alas, you won't be able to extend your certificate to all possible subdomains using a wildcard as it is [only supported starting with their *«Pro»* offer](http://wiki.gandi.net/questions/fr/ssl/csr/multi-domaine-non-accepte).*

Have a coffee.

## Enter <del>Sandman</del> Franz Kafka

Next, head to your [Gandi domain management page](https://www.gandi.net/admin/domain), select your domain, click on  *SSL Certificate: Manage*, click on *Activate this certificate* then Paste the content of the generated `domain.tld.csr` file into the textarea and submit the form. Then wait for some email from Gandi to confirm your demand.

In the meanwhile, [retrieve the intermediate certificate](http://wiki.gandi.net/en/ssl/intermediate) from the [SSL certificate management page](https://www.gandi.net/admin/ssl/manage) of your Gandi account, clicking on the tiny magnifying glass next to your domain name (the one with a nicely hidden *«Get the certificate»* tooltip on rollover); you'll get both the certificate and *Gandi's operational certificate authority* files:

- `cert-domain.tld.pem`, where `domain.tld` is your actual domain
- `GandiStandardSSLCA.pem`

Upload them both to your server, store them in eg. `/etc/nginx/certificates/` (nope, this directory is unlikely to exist by default; do as you like).

Last, you have to append the Gandi CA to your domain certificate:

```terminal
$ cat GandiStandardSSLCA.pem >> cert-domain.tld.crt
```

Have a capuccino.

## Configuring the nginx vhost

Here's a sample vhost server configuration for nginx, kept as concise as possible for the sake of brevity and clarity:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name "domain.tld";
    root /var/www/your_website_root;

    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/certificates/cert-domain.tld.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certificates/domain.tld.key;
}
```

Restart nginx and you should be able to access your website using `https://domain.tld/`.

To redirect all HTTP trafic to HTTPS for this server, add this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name "domain.tld";
    rewrite ^(.*) https://$host$1 permanent;
}
```

Have a latte.

## Conclusion

At this point, you should be seriously considering quitting caffeine. As a positive note, it looks like the whole process will be revamped in *some weeks*:

</blockquote>

If you're looking for other alternatives than Gandi for getting SSL certs, it seems that many people are speaking well of [StartSSL](http://www.startssl.com/) despite their ugly site, but I didn't use the service myself.
