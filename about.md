![me](/static/img/me.png)

My name is **Nicolas Perriault**, I live in southern France near Montpellier and
am pretty much **enjoying my life**. I work remotely for
[Allo-Media](https://www.allo-media.fr/) as a Frontend Engineer.

I'm mostly a [Web developer](/code/).
I [speak](/talks/) at conferences,
<del>sometimes</del> rarely.

I also practice [photography](https://500px.com/n1k0),
and [rant (in French)](/carnet/) <del>a bit too much</del> rarely.

If you're interested, the source code of this blog and most of its contents are
[open source](https://github.com/n1k0/nicolas.perriault.net).
